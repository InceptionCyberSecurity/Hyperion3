ins31.sh is the install script but edit to suit your preferences.<br/>
test.sh is a short script to confirm all is working ok. <br/>

# Usage
* Most scripts take two command line arguments, the IP address or domain name, and directory to store reports. <br/>
* For example ./server mysite.com mystuff . See READMEscripts.md for details of command line arguments. <br/>
* Reports are in a custom directory which is displayed at command prompt after completion. <br/>
